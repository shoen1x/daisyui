## Ruby on Rails

Ruby on Rails has revolutionized web development with its elegant syntax and developer-centric philosophy. Having built numerous Rails applications over the years, I'm still impressed by how it prioritizes developer happiness.

What makes Rails special is its opinionated approach. By embracing "Convention over Configuration" and "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principles, Rails eliminates countless decisions that would otherwise slow down development.

The framework's comprehensive ecosystem is remarkable. From database migrations and ORM through Active Record to testing frameworks and the asset pipeline, Rails provides a cohesive environment where all pieces work together harmoniously.

I particularly appreciate how Rails encourages best practices like TDD, RESTful design, and concerns separation. These guardrails help teams of any size build maintainable applications that can evolve over time without accumulating technical debt.

## Ruby on Rails + daisyUI

As a long-time Rails developer, I've found daisyUI to be the perfect Tailwind CSS component library that aligns beautifully with Rails' philosophy of developer happiness and productivity.

Here's why this combination works so wonderfully:

- **ERB template harmony**: daisyUI's semantic class names like `btn` and `card` integrate naturally with Rails' ERB templates, keeping your views clean and readable.

- **Asset pipeline integration**: daisyUI works seamlessly with Rails' asset pipeline or the newer Webpacker/esbuild approaches, making setup straightforward.

- **View helpers synergy**: Rails' view helpers pair perfectly with daisyUI components, allowing you to create reusable UI patterns that follow Rails conventions.

- **Rapid prototyping**: Just as Rails accelerates backend development, daisyUI speeds up UI creation, letting you build complete features in record time.

This powerful combination allows Rails developers to maintain their famous productivity while creating beautiful interfaces without compromising on the maintainability that Rails is known for.

<div dir="ltr" class="left-[50%] rtl:left-[-50%] relative translate-x-[-50%] rtl:translate-x-[50%] my-12 w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]">
  <Testimonials items={data.testimonials} limit="6" />
</div>

## Install Tailwind CSS and daisyUI for Ruby on Rails

Setting up daisyUI in your Rails project is refreshingly simple, fitting perfectly with Rails' developer-friendly approach.

Start with a Rails application - either an existing one or create a new one using `rails new`. Rails 7+ makes working with modern frontend tools particularly smooth.

Add Tailwind CSS to your Rails application using either the asset pipeline or esbuild/webpack, depending on your Rails version and preferences. The Tailwind CSS documentation for Rails provides excellent guidance for both approaches.

Then add daisyUI as a Tailwind plugin with just a few lines of configuration, and you're ready to go.

Once configured, you can immediately start using daisyUI's component classes in your ERB templates, creating beautiful interfaces that leverage all of Rails' powerful features.
