## Angular

Angular stands as one of the most robust frontend frameworks available today, built and maintained by Google to handle enterprise-level applications with ease.

Having worked with Angular on multiple large-scale projects, I've come to appreciate its comprehensive approach. Unlike more minimal frameworks, Angular provides a complete solution out of the box.

The framework excels with its powerful features like dependency injection, which makes components testable and maintainable, and its use of TypeScript, which catches errors early through static typing.

Angular's CLI is a massive productivity booster, automating common tasks from project scaffolding to deployment. For large teams working on complex applications, Angular's opinionated structure and comprehensive documentation ensure consistency across codebases.

## Angular + daisyUI

After years of building Angular applications, I've found daisyUI to be an exceptional Tailwind CSS component library that addresses many common UI challenges in Angular projects.

Here's why Angular and daisyUI make such a strong pair:

- **Enterprise-ready components**: daisyUI provides professionally designed UI components that meet the high standards expected in Angular's typical enterprise environments.

- **Zero JavaScript overhead**: Since daisyUI is purely CSS-based, it adds no conflicting JavaScript that might interfere with Angular's change detection or component lifecycle.

- **TypeScript friendly**: Angular's TypeScript-first approach pairs perfectly with daisyUI's predictable class-based styling system.

- **Design system implementation**: The library's 35+ built-in themes and CSS variables make it easy for Angular teams to implement and maintain consistent design systems across large applications.

This combination significantly accelerates development while maintaining the structure and performance that Angular projects demand.

<div dir="ltr" class="left-[50%] rtl:left-[-50%] relative translate-x-[-50%] rtl:translate-x-[50%] my-12 w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]">
  <Testimonials items={data.testimonials} limit="6" />
</div>

## Install Tailwind CSS and daisyUI for Angular

Setting up daisyUI in your Angular project is straightforward and well-supported.

Begin by creating a new Angular project using the Angular CLI if you don't have one already. Angular's modern workflow makes integrating Tailwind CSS particularly smooth.

Install Tailwind CSS and configure it according to Angular's official documentation, then add daisyUI as a plugin in your Tailwind configuration.

Once set up, you can immediately start using daisyUI's semantic component classes in your Angular templates, creating beautiful interfaces while maintaining Angular's powerful data binding capabilities.
